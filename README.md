Question 1
Problem 1:
Using sqoop, import orders table into hdfs to folders /user/cloudera/problem1/orders. File should be loaded as Avro File and use snappy compression
Using sqoop, import order_items  table into hdfs to folders /user/cloudera/problem1/order-items. Files should be loaded as avro file and use snappy compression
Using Spark Scala load data at /user/cloudera/problem1/orders and /user/cloudera/problem1/orders-items items as dataframes. 
Expected Intermediate Result: Order_Date , Order_status, total_orders, total_amount. In plain english, please find total orders and total amount per status per day. The result should be sorted by order date in descending, order status in ascending and total amount in descending and total orders in ascending. Aggregation should be done using below methods. However, sorting can be done using a dataframe or RDD. Perform aggregation in each of the following ways
a). Just by using Data Frames API - here order_date should be YYYY-MM-DD format
b). Using Spark SQL  - here order_date should be YYYY-MM-DD format
c). By using combineByKey function on RDDS -- No need of formatting order_date or total_amount
 Store the result as parquet file into hdfs using gzip compression under folder
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4a-gzip
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4b-gzip
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4c-gzip
 Store the result as parquet file into hdfs using snappy compression under folder
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4a-snappy
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4b-snappy
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4c-snappy
Store the result as CSV file into hdfs using No compression under folder
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4a-csv
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4b-csv
/user/cloudera/problem1/result4c-csv
create a mysql table named result and load data from /user/cloudera/problem1/result4a-csv to mysql table named result
